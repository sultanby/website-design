zt. Bolkit Serif is a typeface with two types of styles, one with an elegant and smooth arch shape, while the other has a type of firmness and the character presents a strong character in it. Being a letter whose concept is very interested in simplicity, the lines present in the elegant and firm zt. Bolkit make you feel it too.

zt. Bolkit also comes with two widths that all have two weights (Thin and Bold) Containing characters that include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, punctuation, 52 ligatures, 25 alternatives and symbols that will make your designs cooler in the future.
